## Website architecture and entry points

- The site is a static TypeScript + Vite app. Entry script is [src/main.ts](mdc:src/main.ts).
- Content is rendered into server-provided containers in `index.html` via functions from `src/components/` (e.g., `renderHeader`, `renderHero`).
- Assets live in `public/` and are served at the site root (e.g., `/logo-full-v1.svg`).
- Build and dev scripts: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run preview` (see [package.json](mdc:package.json)).
- Keep functions pure: components return HTML strings; `main.ts` injects them and binds events.
